/* 
Declare a variable called firstName and assign a string value to it (you choose what it is).

Now write a function that takes a string parameter, expecting a name. 

The function should return a new string that uses the name in a full sentence. 

You decided what the sentence should say. In the function declare a new variable called age and assign it to the value 43.

Use your function and put in the argument “Ben”. Prove to yourself that the function works the way it should. 

Finally, explain, and if possible provide evidence for your answer: what is the scope of `age`?

let firstName = 'Merima'

function greet(name){
    let age = 43
    return `Hello, ${name}! How are you today?`
} console.log(greet("Ben"));
